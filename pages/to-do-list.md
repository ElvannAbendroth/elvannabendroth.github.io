This is the list of things I am currently working on on this Jekyll website. Currently I am trying to develop a theme based on Poole, and inspired by Lanyon and Hyde. The themes I am basing this work on are developed by @mdo .

## Current Issues

### Sidebar Styling

- Make navbar responsive
- Menu styling
- On click in main close nav
- Add close on escape key

### Layout Issues

- Title tags in .md files are not generating is the title is an ID (Sidebar, Main, Folder)
- I might want to also revisit `_grid.scss` . Include it in `_layout.scss` and revisit its structure for something more functional and efficient.
- 404 page layout is centered and looks odd.

## Upcoming Features

### Queued Up

- User Theme Selection (Light and Dark Mode)

### Ideas

- User Theme Selection (Theme Color)
- Make extra "folder" buttons for easier navigation and different styles of options.
