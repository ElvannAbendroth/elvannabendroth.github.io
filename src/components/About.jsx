            Hi, my name is Oodri and I'm a junior fullstack
            web developer living in Helsinki. I also play
            the harp, sing, and love D&D and TTRPG games.

          <p>
            My interest for web development stems from my
            enjoyment for problem solving & challenges.

            in Music. In my work as an entrepreneur,
            learning to be autonomous, adaptive and
            resourceful have been an absolute requirements.
            I think these skills would make me a great asset
            for your team.

            Science and studied there for 1 year, which
            allowed me to learn some of the basics of
            programming. More recently I have been working
