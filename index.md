Hey there! Welcome to my Github Page! My name is Elvann and I'm a music artist and web developer! On this website, I'd love to share resources I create, my thoughts and other fun project I'm working on!

Here a couple things on my mind I'd like to share:

- Coding Projects
- UI & UX Designs
- Music Learning Resources
- Language Learning & Finnish Language

See you around!
